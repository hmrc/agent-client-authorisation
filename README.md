### Running the tests <a name="runningTests"></a>

    sbt test it:test


### Running the application locally <a name="runningLocal"></a>
To run application requires the following prerequisites:
* Service Manager (See: [Installation Guidance](https://github.com/hmrc/service-manager/wiki/Install#install-service-manager))
* MongoDB 3.2

The command to use is:

    sm --start AGENT_MTD -f


Alternatively run from source alone:

    sm --start AGENT_CLIENT_AUTHORISATION


or

    sbt run


However, it is advised to run AGENT_MTD profile which comes with authentication applications because each api requires authentication for use.
